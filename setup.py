PycURL -- A Python Interface To The cURL library
================================================

PycURL is a Python interface to `libcurl`_, the multiprotocol file
transfer library. Similarly to the urllib_ Python module,
PycURL can be used to fetch objects identified by a URL from a Python program.
Beyond simple fetches however PycURL exposes most of the functionality of
libcurl, including:

- Speed - libcurl is very fast and PycURL, being a thin wrapper above
  libcurl, is very fast as well. PycURL `was benchmarked`_ to be several
  times faster than requests_.
- Features including multiple protocol support, SSL, authentication and
  proxy options. PycURL supports most of libcurl's callbacks.
- Multi_ and share_ interfaces.
- Sockets used for network operations, permitting integration of PycURL
  into the application's I/O loop (e.g., using Tornado_).

.. _share: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-share.html
.. _Tornado: http://www.tornadoweb.org/


Requirements
------------

- Python 2.7 or 3.4 through 3.6.
- libcurl 7.19.0 or better.


Installation
------------

Download source and binary distributions from `PyPI`_ or `Bintray`_.
Binary wheels are now available for 32 and 64 bit Windows versions.

Please see `the installation documentation`_ for installation instructions.

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycurl
.. _Bintray: https://dl.bintray.com/pycurl/pycurl/
.. _the installation documentation: http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/install.html


Documentation
-------------

Documentation for the most recent PycURL release is available on
`PycURL website <http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/>`_.


Support
-------

For support questions please use `curl-and-python mailing list`_.
`Mailing list archives`_ are available for your perusal as well.

Although not an official support venue, `Stack Overflow`_ has been
popular with some PycURL users.

Bugs can be reported `via GitHub`_. Please use GitHub only for bug
reports and direct questions to our mailing list instead.
